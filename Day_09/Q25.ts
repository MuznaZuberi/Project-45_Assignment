//  Aliens Colors 1 : Imagine that in a game, an alien was shot down. Create a variable called alien_color and assign a value of "green", "yellow", or "red" to it.

let alien_color: string = "Green";

// 1.  Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If that's the case, print out a report indicating that this player has gotten five points.

if(alien_color == "Green"){
	console.log('"Five points have just been awarded to the player"');
}




//2.  • Make a version of this program that passes the if test and one that fails. No output will be given if the version is not successful.

alien_color = "Yellow";

if(alien_color == "Green"){
  //"No output will be given if the version is not successful";
}
