//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let cars: string[] = ["TOYOTA", "SUZUKI", "HUNDAI", "CHERY", "AUDI", "KIA MOTORS", "MERCEDES-BENZ"];
for(let c of cars){
	console.log("I would like to own a ", c , "car");
}
